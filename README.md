### Elevator pitch

Dash Link enables users to create shareable feedback links, allowing users to collect feedback effortlessly.
Users can manage all feedback in a single dashboard with real-time notifications and daily summaries.

### Design

![Main Dashboard image](assets/dashLink-mockup-03.jpg)
![Shareable Link "Customer View" image](assets/dashLink-mockup-02.jpg)

Here is an idea of how users will interact with the website.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  actor User as User
  participant DL as Dash Link
  participant SL as Shareable Link
  actor Customer as Customer
  User ->> DL: Authenticate User
  DL ->> SL: Create Feedback Link
  Customer ->> SL: Post Feedback via Link
  SL ->> DL: Receive Feedback Post from Link
  DL ->> User: Notify of New Feedback
  User ->> DL: Manage Feedback (View, Delete, Contact Customer)
```

3. **Responsive to Window Resizing**

   - Ensured a **fluid design** with `w-full` and `max-w-lg`.
   - Verified **responsiveness** using `flex-wrap` and `grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2`.

4. **Properly Styled Application Elements**

   - Styled **cards, modals, and buttons** using **DaisyUIâ€™s `card`, `btn`, and `modal` components**.

### ðŸ”¹ 5. Create an HTTP service using Node.js and Express
- Implemented full backend in `service/index.js`

---

### ðŸ”¹ 6. Frontend served up using Express static middleware
- Configured with `express.static("public")` middleware
- Runs bundled frontend from Vite using standard setup

---

### ðŸ”¹ 7. Your frontend calls third-party service endpoints
- Used the [goqr.me](https://goqr.me/api/) API to dynamically generate and download QR codes  
  - Integrated in `dashlinkDashboard.jsx` for the download button

---

### ðŸ”¹ 8. Your backend provides service endpoints
- âœ… Fully working backend with these APIs:
  - `POST /api/auth/create` â€“ Create new user
  - `POST /api/auth/login` â€“ Login user
  - `DELETE /api/auth/logout` â€“ Logout user
  - `GET /api/user/me` â€“ Get authenticated user info
  - `POST /api/dashlink/create` â€“ Create new dashlink
  - `GET /api/dashlink/list` â€“ List userâ€™s dashlinks
  - `GET /api/dashboard/list` â€“ List all posts (protected)
  - `PUT /api/dashboard/resolved/:id` â€“ Mark post as resolved
  - `DELETE /api/dashboard/delete/:id` â€“ Delete post
  - `GET /api/post/list` â€“ List public feedback posts
  - `PUT /api/post/upvote/:id` â€“ Upvote a public post
  - `POST /api/post/create` â€“ Submit a public feedback post

---

### ðŸ”¹ 9. Your frontend calls your service endpoints
- Frontend fetches from backend using `/api/*` routes:
  - Auth logic in `login.jsx`
  - Dashlink creation/listing in `clientDashboard.jsx`
  - Post interaction in `dashlinkDashboard.jsx`
  - Anonymous post creation and upvoting in `publicLink.jsx`

---

### ðŸ”¹ 10. Supports registration, login, logout, and restricted endpoint
- `/login.jsx` supports full register/login flow using backend
- Auth token stored in a secure, `httpOnly` cookie
- `ProtectedRoute.jsx` guards access to `/clientDashboard` and `/dashlinkDashboard`
- `/api/user/me` confirms current auth status before route access
